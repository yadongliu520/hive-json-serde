Hive is a fantastic addition to Hadoop, but as at this writing, there is no publicly available JSON SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) to read and write JSON data, so I created this little open source project.

For more information, please view the [ProjectOverview](ProjectOverview.md) and have a look at the [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md).

For information on using the JSON Serde, check out the [GettingStarted](GettingStarted.md) page.

Release JARs are available on the left, and the source code is up top.

Feel free to create an Issue if you discover a bug or would like a new feature.
